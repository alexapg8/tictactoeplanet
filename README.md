# Tic-Tac-Toe-Planet!
## who will conquer the universe?

### A spin to the normal tic-tac-toe we are looking for who will conquer the world!?

### Insert your name into the planet and let's begin!

#### The main idea for the game in general as well as for how to achieve the functionality I was looking for was all developed by me with my previous knowledge.

##### This code was made with Vuejs, referencing the following sites:
  - The whole learning of the language was based on the exercises provided my the professor: https://github.com/christinebittle/vuepractice
  - The format for the HTML board and player cards was based on : Sarah Drasner, https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/owaWwd , accessed June 30th 2020.
  I had tried several other ways to show my board for the game, through just app and components with for loop but was not getting the end result I wanted,
  this code help me understand the way the components work better and simpler, using the component inside a for loop which hold all the information, including the template, of what I want to show.
  This way I was able to get the components to function on their own and when clicked only the manipulated one would call the function.
  - Before and between coding I read throught the official documentation :https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html where I got the main code for the input field where the users enters their name. I added the functionality of it disappearing when the user clicks enter.
